## Overview

  
  <p>
    Through the object model management provided by the supOS platform, the
    digital modeling of production units such as workshops, staff, equipment,
    products and materials in the factory is realized.
  </p>
  
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create models based on the features of equipment in the factory, to manage
      and apply the business information such as attributes, operating status,
      maintenance records and fault records.
    </li>
    <li>
      The object models describe the job responsibilities of different roles in
      the factory, and features of various materials.
    </li>
  </ul>

  ## Object Model


   <p>
    A complete object model contains an object template, an object instance and
    a function set, representing the corresponding product type, specific
    product and product functions respectively. For each model, you need to
    configure the following parameters.
  </p>
  

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Basic Information</strong>: Describes the model name, aliases,
      parent templates, function sets, and details.
    </li>
  </ul>
 


:::info


Object aliases must be unique under one name space (APP or system).

:::
  

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Attributes</strong>: Describes attributes of object instances.{" "}
      <ul className="li-ul">
    <li>
      <strong>Attribute Info</strong>: Displays the current status of an object
      instance, such as device name, device number, temperature, pressure and
      speed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Alarm</strong> <strong>rules</strong>: Defines rules of alarm
      events. When the collected data is updated, the supOS platform judges
      whether to trigger an alarm based on the rules.
    </li>
  </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
 

  
 

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Services</strong>: Functions that you can use instance properties
      to realize.
      <ul className="li-ul">
    <li>You can define one or more services for each object instance.</li>
    <li>Services can be used by other features on the platform.</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
 

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Events</strong>: Messages sent by object instances and subscribed
      by external parties.
      <ul className="li-ul">
    <li>
      An event is triggered when the data source changes or the configured logic
      applies.
    </li>
    <li>
      A subscriber who listens to the event should be created during modeling.
    </li>
    <li>
      A data set containing the event-triggering field must be linked with the
      event.
    </li>
  </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

:::info

Field names in the data set must be the same as aliases of the instance
    properties.
:::

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Receives and responses to events.
      <ul className="li-ul">
    <li>
      Uses data set linked with the event to define reactions based on business
      logic.
    </li>
    <li>The same event can be subscribed by multiple subscribers.</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
